# 1-Click Upgrade

## About

Provides an automated method to upgrade your shop to the latest version of PrestaShop.
This module is compatible with all PrestaShop 1.6 & 1.7.

# Prerequisites

* PrestaShop 1.6 or 1.7
* PHP 5.6+ 

For older PHP versions, see previous releases of the module [(ex. v1.6.8)](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v1.6.8).
Note they are unsupported and we strongly recommend you to upgrade your PHP version.

# Installation

All versions can be found in the [releases list](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases).

## Create a module from source code
* Clone (`git clone https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade.git`) or [download](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/archive/master.zip) the source code. You can also download a release **Source code** ([ex. v4.4.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/archive/v4.4.1.zip)). If you download a source code archive, you need extract the file and rename the extracted folder to **autoupgrade**
* Enter into folder **autoupgrade** and run the command `composer install`  ([composer](https://getcomposer.org/)).
* Create a new zip file of **autoupgrade** folder
* Now you can upload into your module pages

# Running an upgrade on PrestaShop

Upgrading a shop can be done via:

* the configuration page of the module (access from your BO module page)
* in command line by calling the file *cli-upgrade.php*

## Command line parameters

Upgrade can be automated by calling *cli-upgrade.php*.
The following parameters are mandatory:

* **--dir**: Tells where the admin directory is.
* **--channel**: Selects what upgrade to run (minor, major etc.)

```
$ php cli-upgrade.php --dir=admin-dev --channel=major
```
